Artificial neural networks are used in machine learning to perform tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, and prediction. They are a key element in deep learning, which has led to significant advancements in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.\n",

            "3. Association for Neuroscience Nursing: This is a professional organization for neuroscience nurses and healthcare professionals. The organization provides education, research, and advocacy for nurses who care for patients with neurological conditions.\n",
            "4. Advanced Nursing Practice: This is a level of nursing practice that requires advanced education, clinical expertise, and decision-making skills. Advanced practice nurses often have specialized roles, such as nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, nurse anesthetists, or nurse midwives.\n",
